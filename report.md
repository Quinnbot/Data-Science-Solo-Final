# Introduction

to start this project I knew I wanted to do something on Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) stats. I watch pro CSGO sometimes and I would think it would be fun to be able to predict the outcome of matches based on minimal stats. 

# Selection of Data

this dataset comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrieltardochi/counter-strike-global-offensive-matches). not much was changed besides using specific colum.

I explored the idea to predict the out come of each round but I couldn't really find enough data to actually run tests.

# Methods
using linear regression and KNN because im kind of familiar with these methods from taking machine learning during the spring semester.
# Results
The results are inconclusive. I need more time to study what data points would be the best. I also didn't get the chance to test my models out.
